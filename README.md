- 👋 Hi, I’m @SudoWarrior317

- 👀 I’m interested in **leveraging technology for social impact**, specifically exploring:
    - Innovative solutions to **solve homelessness** using sustainable and affordable housing models.
    - **Blockchain technology**, DAOs, and Web3 concepts for transparent governance and community empowerment.
    - **Decentralized systems** for resource management (energy, water).
    - **Sustainable architecture**, modular construction, and circular economy principles.
    - Open-source development and community building.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **more about and developing solutions involving**:
    - Smart contract development (exploring frameworks like Foundry/Hardhat).
    - Decentralized identity and privacy-preserving technologies (like zk-proofs).
    - Implementing Proof of Involvement (PoI) systems.
    - Community Land Trust (CLT) structures and integration with decentralized governance.
    - Full-stack app development for user interaction with decentralized systems.
    - Practical applications of AI (like watsonx) for social good projects.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on **the Genesis Housing Initiative**:
    - An open-source project aiming to provide free, sustainable housing via blockchain and community models.
    - Developing and piloting decentralized governance (DAO) and economic (PoI) systems.
    - Research and implementation of low-cost, sustainable modular housing designs (especially for climates like Arizona).
    - Anyone interested in affordable housing, blockchain for good, sustainable tech, or community building!
